//! What `wait_ticket` does (`tools`): waits until one of the tickets named changes, then says what
//! changed. It replaces the loop a client wrote with `get_ticket`, which read a ticket every few
//! seconds and missed what came and went between two reads (a request asked and answered, a block
//! put away). What is watched is what a client acts on: the column, the block, an agent that waits
//! for an answer, an agent at rest in « À tester » (the ticket can be approved), the ticket gone.
//! Each answer gives `since`, what it saw of each ticket: the next call compares the tickets with
//! it, so a ticket whose state differs from it is told at once, a change made between two calls
//! included (one that came back to its first state is not seen). Without it, the state at the call
//! is the one compared. The tools of the flow give one too, the ticket as it was before their action:
//! an approval over before the client waits is told all the same. A wait ends when its client gives
//! the request up (its connection closes): there is no one to answer.
