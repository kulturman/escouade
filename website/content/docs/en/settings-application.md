# Settings: Application

This page describes the settings window (its tabs, how to open it, how it saves) and its “Application” tab, which sets the language of the interface and the language of the texts Claude writes.

## The settings window

Escouade’s settings live in a single window, with one tab per topic. Open it with `Ctrl+,` (`⌘,` on macOS) or with the ⚙ button in the [status bar](interface). It opens on the “Claude Code” tab, unless a button opens it straight on the tab that concerns it: the ⚙ button in the header of the [Kanban](board) opens “Kanban”, and a project’s menu opens “Projects”. The shortcut does nothing while another dialog is open.

### The tabs

The left column lists the tabs, with Escouade’s version at the bottom. The name and description of the tab you are on sit at the top of the right-hand side. When the focus is on the list, the up and down arrows move from tab to tab, and `Home` and `End` jump to the first and the last.

| Tab | What it sets |
|---|---|
| “Application” | Language of the interface and of texts written by Claude |
| [“Claude Code”](settings-claude-code) | Executable, model, and default permissions |
| [“Claude accounts”](settings-accounts) | The accounts agents start on, saved as you change them |
| [“Notifications”](settings-notifications) | Visual and sound alerts |
| [“Projects”](settings-projects) | Settings specific to each project |
| [“Kanban”](settings-board) | Autopilot and approved tickets |
| [“Integrations”](settings-integrations) | Jira, Trello, GitHub Issues, and Linear |
| [“Terminals”](settings-terminals) | Shells available in the built-in terminals |
| [“Network”](settings-network) | HTTP(S) proxy and TLS certificates for Claude Code, integrations, and updates |
| [“About”](settings-about) | Version and local data |

“Projects”, “Kanban”, and “Integrations” set one project at a time. Under the header, a “Project” row offers one button per open project, with its color swatch and its name. The window starts on the project you are viewing, or on the one belonging to the button that opened it. Switching projects does not lose what you changed on the others. With no project open, these tabs say “No project open.”.

### Save or cancel

Changes go into a draft: nothing applies until you click “Save”. A dot on a tab (tooltip “Modified, not saved yet”) means it holds changes that are not saved.

- “Save” saves everything that changed in one go, across all tabs and all projects. The window closes and shows “Settings saved”. If one part fails, an error message appears, the window stays open, and whatever was saved no longer counts as a change.
- “Cancel”, the cross, `Esc`, or a click on the backdrop closes the window and throws the draft away, without asking for confirmation. When you reopen it, everything starts again from what is saved.
- When a problem prevents saving, a red message appears at the bottom left, names the project concerned (even if it is not the one on screen), and “Save” is grayed out. There are three cases: a project has lost its name; a launch command has no name or no command line; the worktrees folder or a branch prefix of a project is not valid.

### What saves right away

Two places do not wait for the button, because a “Cancel” could not undo what they write to disk: the “Claude accounts” tab, where each change goes through the moment you make it, and the “Claude and the agents can drive Escouade” switch on the “Claude Code” tab.

## The “Application” tab

The tab has two groups, “Language” and “Dictation”. Both language choices take effect as soon as you save, with no restart: the window, the app’s menus, and the texts Escouade writes switch to the new language.

| Setting | Effect | Default |
|---|---|---|
| “Interface language” | The language of the window, the app’s menus, and the messages Escouade shows. | “System” |
| “Language of texts written by Claude” | The language of what Claude writes for you: commits, pull requests, comments, instructions to agents. | “Same as the interface (default)” |

### Interface language

Three choices, each written in its own language so you can find yours whatever language the interface is in:

- “System (French)” follows the computer’s language. Escouade comes in French and English: it picks French when the first preferred language of the system is French, English otherwise. The system’s language is named in the interface’s language, so a French system with an English interface gives “System (French)”.
- “English”.
- “Français”.

The change also reaches the app’s native menus and the tooltip of the taskbar icon.

### Language of texts written by Claude

This choice decides which language Escouade asks Claude to use for what leaves the app:

- the proposed commit messages and pull request descriptions, see [Git](git);
- the comments posted to Jira, Trello, GitHub, and Linear, see [the integrations](integrations);
- the instructions Escouade gives to agents.

The three choices are “Same as the interface (default)”, “English”, and “Français”. With “Same as the interface”, the proposed commit message follows the language of the repository’s latest commits, to blend in. With “English” or “Français”, that language is the one asked for.

> [!TIP]
> Many teams commit in English with an interface in French: pick “Français” for the interface and “English” for the texts Claude writes.

## Dictation

The “Dictation” group sets up [message dictation](chat#dictating-a-message). The microphone is transcribed on your machine by Whisper; nothing goes online.

| Setting | Effect | Default |
|---|---|---|
| “Model” | The speech model. The bigger, the more accurate and the slower. The one chosen is downloaded on the first dictation if missing. | “Small” (190 MB) |
| “Spoken language” | The language you speak. Automatic detection is wrong more often on a short prompt. | “Interface language” |

The models offered: “Tiny” (78 MB, the fastest, often wrong), “Base” (148 MB, fast, rough), “Small” (190 MB, accurate and fast, recommended), “Large turbo” (574 MB, the most accurate, for a powerful machine). Each line says whether the model is installed: “Download” fetches it right away (with a progress bar and “Cancel”), “Delete” frees its disk space. The model and language you choose are saved with the other settings; downloading and deleting act right away.
